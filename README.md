# optim_from_scratch

Notebook and report implementing optimization methods from scratch only using numpy methods: 

The problematic is to be able to predict how addictive is a person's personality using their personality traits (Neuroticism, Openness to experience ...) and other ethnical, biological and societal features.

- Data pre-processing, exploration and visualization

The optimisation methods implemented are :

- Constant gradient descent 
- Accelerated gradient descent 
- Stochastic gradient descent 
- Diagonal Scaling (AdaGrad-RMSProp)
- Regularisation (Lasso)
- Variance Reduction Technique (SAGA) 
- Second-order methods (Newton Raphson)
